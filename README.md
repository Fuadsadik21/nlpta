# 🇪🇹 NLPTA — NLP Toolkit for Amharic

> `pip install nlpta`

**NLPTA** (NLP Toolkit for Amharic) is the first open-source, pip-installable Python package designed specifically for **Amharic Natural Language Processing**. Built to accelerate research and development in Ethiopian AI, NLPTA provides essential preprocessing utilities, dataset loaders, and pretrained word embeddings — all trained on real, publicly sourced Amharic text.

Whether you’re a researcher, student, startup, or government developer — if you’re working with Amharic text, NLPTA is your starting point.

## 🚀 Why NLPTA?

### ❗ The Problem

Amharic is spoken by over 30 million people and is Ethiopia’s official working language. Yet, it remains a **low-resource language** in NLP. Unlike English or Chinese, there are:
- ❌ No standardized preprocessing tools
- ❌ No pretrained embeddings readily available
- ❌ No curated, reusable datasets
- ❌ No pip-installable libraries

This forces every researcher and developer to **reinvent the wheel** — slowing down innovation across academia, industry, and public sector AI projects in Ethiopia.

### ✅ The Solution

NLPTA solves this by providing:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧹 **Text Cleaning & Normalization** | Remove punctuation, normalize whitespace, handle common noise |
| 🔤 **Tokenization** | Split Amharic text into meaningful tokens |
| 🚫 **Stopword Removal** | Filter out grammatical glue words (e.g., `በ`, `የ`, `ው`) |
| 📚 **Dataset Loader** | Load sample corpus from Wikipedia, BBC Amharic, EBC, and more |
| 🧠 **Pretrained Embeddings** | Word2Vec vectors trained on 50k+ lines of real Amharic text |
| 📓 **Jupyter Notebooks** | Ready-to-run tutorials for quick onboarding |
| 📦 **pip-installable** | `pip install nlpta` — no setup headaches |
